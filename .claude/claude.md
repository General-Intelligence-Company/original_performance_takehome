# Claude Agent Documentation

## File Structure

This repository uses `.claude/claude.md` as the primary agent documentation file. Always attempt to read this file directly - do not check for existence first. If the file doesn't exist, create the `.claude/` directory and `claude.md` file at this exact path.
