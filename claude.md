# Claude Code Agent Guidelines

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working on this repository.

## Git Workflow

Before creating branches or pushing:

1. Check current status: `git status`
2. List existing branches: `git branch -a`
3. Check if you have push permissions: `git remote -v`
4. Work on the main branch first, only create feature branches if explicitly needed
5. Commit changes locally before attempting to push: `git add . && git commit -m "description"`

**Important**: Do not automatically create branches like `cofounder/optimization-v1` or push to origin without first verifying repository permissions and existing branch structure.

## Testing

Before running tests, always verify the test setup:

1. **Check that test files exist**: `ls tests/`
2. **Run the test suite**: `python tests/submission_tests.py`
3. **If direct execution fails**, try running from the repository root or importing programmatically:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/repo && python tests/submission_tests.py
   ```
4. **Alternative approach** if module imports fail:
   ```bash
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); exec(open('tests/submission_tests.py').read())"
   ```
5. **Verify test output**: Tests report cycle counts and speedup metrics. A successful run shows `CYCLES: <number>` and test pass/fail status.

The test file `tests/submission_tests.py` uses Python's unittest framework and tests both correctness and performance against various benchmarks.

## Git Workflow Best Practices

Before creating branches or pushing changes:

1. **Always fetch latest main**: `git fetch origin main`
2. **Check if main has new commits**: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
3. **If main has moved, rebase your branch**: `git rebase origin/main`
4. **Resolve any conflicts before pushing**
5. **Use `--force-with-lease` for force pushes**: This avoids overwriting others' work

**Why this matters**: Pushing without checking if main has moved can cause merge conflicts and force other collaborators to resolve issues that could have been handled locally.

## Performance Measurement

To get consistent performance measurements:

1. Use a standardized test script: `python -c "from problem import *; # run your test here"`
2. Run measurements multiple times to check for consistency
3. Clear any cached state between runs if needed
4. Document your current best result and the method used to achieve it
5. Always verify correctness before measuring performance
