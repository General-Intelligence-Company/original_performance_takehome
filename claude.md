# Claude Code Agent Guidelines

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working on this repository.

## Before Adding Documentation

Before creating new documentation:
1. Check if `claude.md` or `AGENTS.md` already exists
2. Read existing content to understand current guidelines
3. Add to existing sections rather than creating duplicate guidance
4. Use consistent formatting and style with existing documentation

## Git Workflow

**Before creating any branch or making changes:**

1. Run `git fetch origin main` to get latest changes
2. Check if target files already exist: `git show main:filename`
3. If the file exists, read its contents to understand current structure
4. Plan your changes to complement existing content
5. Only then create your feature branch

**For documentation files (claude.md, README.md):** Always assume they may have been updated by others. Merge conflicts in documentation are common and preventable.

**Before creating branches or pushing:**

1. Check current status: `git status`
2. List existing branches: `git branch -a`
3. Check if you have push permissions: `git remote -v`
4. Work on the main branch first, only create feature branches if explicitly needed
5. Commit changes locally before attempting to push: `git add . && git commit -m "description"`

**Important**: Do not automatically create branches like `cofounder/optimization-v1` or push to origin without first verifying repository permissions and existing branch structure.

## Branch Management

**Before creating branches:**

1. Check repository permissions: Can you push to this repo?
2. Review existing branches: `git branch -a`
3. Understand the branching strategy from existing PRs
4. Ensure you have the latest main: `git pull origin main`
5. Only create branches after understanding the codebase and requirements

## Testing

- Always examine test files first: `ls tests/` and `head tests/*.py`
- Check for specific test runners or requirements
- Verify test commands work before documenting them
- Look for existing test documentation in README.md

Before running tests, always verify the test setup:

1. **Check that test files exist**: `ls tests/`
2. **Run the test suite**: `python tests/submission_tests.py`
3. **If direct execution fails**, try running from the repository root or importing programmatically:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/repo && python tests/submission_tests.py
   ```
4. **Alternative approach** if module imports fail:
   ```bash
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); exec(open('tests/submission_tests.py').read())"
   ```
5. **Verify test output**: Tests report cycle counts and speedup metrics. A successful run shows `CYCLES: <number>` and test pass/fail status.

The test file `tests/submission_tests.py` uses Python's unittest framework and tests both correctness and performance against various benchmarks.

## Git Workflow Best Practices

Before creating branches or pushing changes:

1. **Always fetch latest main**: `git fetch origin main`
2. **Check if main has new commits**: `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD`
3. **If main has moved, rebase your branch**: `git rebase origin/main`
4. **Resolve any conflicts before pushing**
5. **Use `--force-with-lease` for force pushes**: This avoids overwriting others' work

**Why this matters**: Pushing without checking if main has moved can cause merge conflicts and force other collaborators to resolve issues that could have been handled locally.

## Performance Measurement

To get consistent performance measurements:

1. Use a standardized test script: `python -c "from problem import *; # run your test here"`
2. Run measurements multiple times to check for consistency
3. Clear any cached state between runs if needed
4. Document your current best result and the method used to achieve it
5. Always verify correctness before measuring performance

## File Naming

- Always use exact case sensitivity when working with files
- Check for existing files before creating new ones: `ls -la | grep -i filename`
- Repository uses lowercase `claude.md` not `CLAUDE.md`
