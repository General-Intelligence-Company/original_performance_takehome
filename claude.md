# Claude Code Guidelines

## Performance Measurement

To get consistent performance measurements:

1. Use a standardized test script: `python -c "from problem import *; # run your test here"`
2. Run measurements multiple times to check for consistency
3. Clear any cached state between runs if needed
4. Document your current best result and the method used to achieve it
5. Always verify correctness before measuring performance
