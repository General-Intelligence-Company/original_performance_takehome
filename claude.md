# Claude Code Agent Guidelines

This file provides guidance for AI coding agents working on this repository.

## Testing

Before running tests, always verify the test setup:

1. **Check that test files exist**: `ls tests/`
2. **Run the test suite**: `python tests/submission_tests.py`
3. **If direct execution fails**, try running from the repository root or importing programmatically:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/repo && python tests/submission_tests.py
   ```
4. **Alternative approach** if module imports fail:
   ```bash
   python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, '.'); exec(open('tests/submission_tests.py').read())"
   ```
5. **Verify test output**: Tests report cycle counts and speedup metrics. A successful run shows `CYCLES: <number>` and test pass/fail status.

The test file `tests/submission_tests.py` uses Python's unittest framework and tests both correctness and performance against various benchmarks.
